                Sending cryptocurrencies is one of the main operations that 
                can be performed with the Xcapit wallet. The user can send 
                both native and non-native tokens. However, it was an action 
                that generated a lot of friction, since the fee that the user 
                must pay for the transaction can only be paid with native tokens. 
                I lead the implementation of the cryptocurrency exchange in order 
                to expand the user's options for obtaining cryptocurrencies for 
                different purposes.

            <p class="problem-desc problem-desc-s">Xcapit from the beginning allowed both native 
                and non-native tokens to be sent and for this the user had to pay 
                a fee that could only be paid with tokens native to the network on 
                which the sending was taking place. For our users, sending crypto 
                was simply sending crypto, but we kept getting feedback that the 
                process of obtaining native tokens to pay the fee was a hassle. 
                How could we simplify obtaining cryptocurrencies for different 
                purposes?</p>

            The experience, which differed depending on the type of token to be 
            sent, combined with the impossibility of obtaining the token needed 
            to complete the transaction, was difficult to handle. Knowing this, 
            we took the opportunity to incorporate a new option to obtain 
            cryptocurrencies not only to be able to make payments and shipments 
            in specific currencies, but also to cover investment fees or protocols, 
            or simply exchange a token for holding.<br />
          <br />
          The cryptocurrency exchange allows you to trade between cryptocurrencies 
          within the same blockchain.  Historically, users could only make 
          transactions on the wallet if they had the native currency to pay the fees.

            <p class="text-description" >
                The main feature of this project was to allow users to exchange 
                cryptocurrencies. This supported different use cases, for example, 
                facilitating transfers for people who prefer to receive money in a 
                specific currency, avoiding the friction of having to manually 
                connect to other platforms to analyse the suitability of fees before 
                converting tokens, and switching between products with different 
                levels of risk or different investment strategies. It is currently 
                possible to swap on the ERC20, Polygon and BSC networks.<br>
                <br>
                A change that resulted in the optimisation of other operations 
                within the app, such as cryptocurrency transfers. Previously, 
                users had to resort to other apps, if they did not have a native 
                token, to obtain it and carry out the operation. Being able to 
                exchange cryptocurrencies allows the entire process to be carried 
                out without the need for external support.

                One of the challenges was for the swap to take place asynchronously. 
                To achieve this, I made sure that the flow allowed the user to continue 
                operating in the wallet at the same time as the swap was being processed 
                on the blockchain. At the end of the transaction, the user would be notified 
                whether it was successful or not. This way, the user is not limited to waiting 
                for processing times on the blockchain to continue using the wallet.</p>

            lagging behind in several aspects. We were catching up. As a result, 
            users were completing their transactions in other applications, but 
            only using xcapit for investing. From interviews and user surveys it 
            became clear that there were major weaknesses in the Xcapit wallet:<br />

                This project was not only important because it was one of the main 
                requests we kept hearing from customers, but it also brought 
                tremendous value to the business. We saw the exchange operation 
                and related functions as a way to increase user engagement, maintain 
                investments (and users) in Xcapit and meet market demand.
                We had the opportunity to be a wallet that solved real problems, 
                unlocked access and enabled mass adoption of decentralised finance. 
                We prioritised a few key features that would be valuable and 
                feasible, which would make the wallet more dynamic:

            <p class="text-description">
                Initially, I explored the different ways in which the user could 
                perform a swap: from the home screen, from the screen of the 
                operation they are trying to perform and from the token detail. 
                I also explored the different scenarios in which a swap could occur 
                and the types of swaps: between two tokens within the same network, 
                between two tokens from different networks. As part of my process, 
                I detailed each flow and weighed the pros and cons of each.<br>
                <br>
                While the need to swap between two tokens of different networks was 
                very likely, it was not technically feasible with the times we had. 
                We focused on intra-network tokens swaps and would learn from them 
                to implement bridges in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="text-description"><b>Swapping in progress</b><br>
                Part of this project also took into account the whole experience 
                of asynchrony. The swap and notifications had to fit within 
                this system.  Every state of the transaction and interaction had 
                to be taken into account to keep the user informed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-description"><b>Testing</b><br>
                We tested initial concepts with users to make sure we were on the 
                right track, before moving the flow into development.

        <p class="problem-desc description" style="text-align: justify;">
            It was a really exciting and fun project for me, as it provides real 
            value, involved a lot of research and detailed interaction work. I 
            learnt some important conclusions from this project related to products 
            and business processes.<br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="problem-desc description" style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to adapt to changing requirements</b><br>
            New timelines, resource issues and reprioritisation meant that the 
            scope of the project changed. I had to adapt to these changes and 
            still deliver the best design on time with tight deadlines.<br>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="problem-desc description" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Always strive for a good UX</b><br>
            I had to work under very strict technical constraints, but I still fight for what I believe is essential 
            to have a good user experience. <br>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="problem-desc description" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Don't over-promise, don't under-deliver</b><br>
            I learned to define a true MVP versus something that simply can't be used and therefore can't be shipped.

        <br />
        <p class="problem-desc description" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Choose what we won't do</b><br>
            There were many excellent use cases that we were able to address with a broad set of functions. However, 
            each of them was costly or unrealistic. I had to learn to determine where the 
            real value was. <br>
