            <h1 class="text-title">Backing up wallet</h1>
            <p class="text-description">
                In the self-custody model, the customer retains full custody 
                (possession) of his assets at all times, using the service provider 
                simply as an interface to conveniently manage his assets. Only the 
                user has access to his funds. This makes it almost impossible for 
                Xcapit, a government or anyone else to prevent you from using your 
                funds exactly as you wish.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, with great power comes great responsibility! Since only 
                you have access to your funds, you need to manage your wallet 
                carefully.  This includes backing up your wallet and following best 
                practices for password management.<br>
                <br>
                The user holds the private key associated with his public address. 
                This, in our case, takes the form of a mnemonic phrase composed of 
                12 randomly generated words.<br>
                <br>
                The backup process consisted of a copy of the recovery phrase or 
                seed phrase. However, this process generated a lot of friction, as 
                users either did not fully understand what the backup consisted of 
                or did not complete the process due to the length and complexity of 
                the process. I lead the redesign of the backup flow and the 
                incorporation of one more option to protect the seed phrase.

            Receiving queries about how to recover the wallet, coupled with 
            several complaints about forgetting the seed phrase, made us realise 
            that there were incorrect assumptions about the behaviour of our users. 
            It was clear that there were several problems to solve:<br />
          <br />
          <b>01. Confusing seed phrase backup process.</b> <br />
          Users were not completing the backup process because they did not 
          understand exactly what they were doing or found it time consuming 
          and confusing.<br />
          <br />
          <b
            >02. Forgetting the seed phrase.</b
          ><br />
          Users who managed to complete the backup lost or forgot their recovery 
          phrase, making it impossible to import the wallet in case they needed 
          to recover it.<br />
          <br />
          <b>03. Poor reach.</b><br />
          Users were poorly alerted to the importance of both backing up the wallet 
          and the relevance of the seed phrase.

                Our vision for the new recovery flow allowed users to back up 
                the seed phrase in two simple steps while adding an extra layer 
                of security by creating an encrypted wallet backup file in Google

                We resolved to implement the recovery phrase backup in two simple 
                steps by clarifying what actions the user must perform in each step.

            <p class="text-description">
                A second layer of security was added by the possibility of creating an 
                encrypted file in Google Drive that could be imported when the wallet needs 
                to be recovered.  This option, like the backup of the seed phrase, is not 
                mandatory and can be done at any time. However, users are advised that it is 
                important to do so when creating the wallet.<br>
            <br>
            With this new option, users can recover their wallet in case of forgetting or losing 
            the seed phrase.<br>
            <br>
            <b>More import options</b><br>
            <br>
            This change also has an impact on the recovery of the wallet, as the 
            user is free to choose either method, as long as both backups have been 
            completed.

              <p class="problem-desc problem-desc-1">The success resulted in an 
                increasing number of users creating backups of their wallets, 
                which not only indicated an awareness of the importance of securing 
                their assets, but also increased levels of engagement. For our users,
                 the main objective of our team was to launch the redesigned backup 
                 flow and the new option of backing up to an encrypted file so that 
                 users could choose whichever way was easiest and quickest for them, 
                 or both. Beyond that, there were higher level objectives for the 
                 company: to increase conversion in the use of the Xcapit wallet 
                 and to consolidate our fractured security paradigm into a 
                 streamlined experience.
